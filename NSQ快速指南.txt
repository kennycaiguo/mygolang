QUICK STARTANCHOR LINK FOR: QUICK START
The following steps will run a small NSQ cluster on your local machine and walk through publishing, consuming, and archiving messages to disk.

1.follow the instructions in the INSTALLING doc.

in one shell, start nsqlookupd:

2. nsqlookupd
in another shell, start nsqd:

3. nsqd --lookupd-tcp-address=127.0.0.1:4160
in another shell, start nsqadmin:

4 nsqadmin --lookupd-http-address=127.0.0.1:4161
publish an initial message (creates the topic in the cluster, too):

5 curl -d 'hello world 1' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=test'
finally, in another shell, start nsq_to_file:

6 nsq_to_file --topic=test --output-dir=/tmp --lookupd-http-address=127.0.0.1:4161
publish more messages to nsqd:

7 curl -d 'hello world 2' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=test'
  curl -d 'hello world 3' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=test'
8.to verify things worked as expected, in a web browser open http://127.0.0.1:4171/ to view the nsqadmin UI and see statistics. Also, check the contents of the log files (test.*.log) written to /tmp.

The important lesson here is that nsq_to_file (the client) is not explicitly told where the test topic is produced, it retrieves this information from nsqlookupd and, despite the timing of the connection, no messages are lost.
